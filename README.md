## Stack Overflow in a JAR

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Erudika/scoold](https://badges.gitter.im/Erudika/scoold.svg)](https://gitter.im/Erudika/scoold?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

**Scoold** is a Q&A platform written in Java. The project was created back in 2008, released in 2012 as social network for
schools inspired by StackOverflow, and as of 2017 it has been refactored, repackaged and open-sourced.
The primary goal of this project is educational but it can also work great as a Q&A/support section for your website.

Scoold can run on Heroku or any other PaaS. It's lightweight (~4000 LOC) - the backend is handled by a separate service called
[Para](https://github.com/Erudika/para). Scoold does not require a database, and the controller logic is really simple
because all the heavy lifting is delegated to Para. This makes the code easy to read and can be learned quickly by junior developers.

### Features

### Live Demo

*Scoold is deployed on a free dyno and it might take a minute to wake up.*
### [Live demo on Heroku](https://live.scoold.com)

### Quick Start

1. Create a new app on [ParaIO.com](https://paraio.com) and save the access keys
2. Click here => [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Erudika/scoold)

**OR**

1. Create a new app on [ParaIO.com](https://paraio.com) and save the access keys OR [run it locally](https://paraio.org/docs/#001-intro)
2. Create `application.conf` and configure Scoold to connect to Para
3. Run `java -jar -Dserver.port=8000 -Dconfig.file=./application.conf scoold.jar` OR `mvn spring-boot:run`
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

**Important:** Do not use the same `application.conf` file for both Para and Scoold!
Keep the two applications in separate directories, each with its own configuration file.

[Read the Para docs for more information.](https://paraio.org/docs)

### Configuration

The most important settings are `para.endpoint` - the URL of the Para server, as well as,
`para.access_key` and `para.secret_key`. Connection to a Para server *is required* for Scoold to run.

This is an example of what your **`application.conf`** should look like:
```
para.app_name = "Scoold"
para.port = 8080
para.env = "development"
para.host_url = "https://live.scoold.com"
para.endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"
para.access_key = "app:scoold"
para.secret_key = "*****************"
para.gmaps_api_key = "********************************"
para.admin_ident = "admin@domain.com"
para.support_email = "support@scoold.com"
para.google_analytics_id = "UA-123456-7"
para.code_highlighting_enabled = true
```

**Note**: On Heroku, the config variables above **must** be set without dots ".", for example `para.endpoint` becomes `para_endpoint`.

### SMTP configuration

Scoold uses the JavaMail API to send emails. If you want Scoold to send notification emails you should add the
following SMTP settings to your config file:

```
para.mail.host = "smtp.example.com"
para.mail.port = 587
para.mail.username = "user@example.com"
para.mail.password = "password"
para.mail.tls = true
para.mail.ssl = false
```
The email template is located in `src/main/resources/emails/notify.html`. 

## Social login

Facebook is the default identity provider for Scoold, and you don't have to specify you FB app secret.
For authenticating with Google, you only need your client id (e.g. `123-abcd.apps.googleusercontent.com`).
For all the other providers, GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter and Microsoft, you need to set both the app id and secret key.
```
# Facebook
para.fb_app_id = "123456789"
# Google
para.google_client_id = "123-abcd.apps.googleusercontent.com"
# GitHub
para.gh_app_id = ""
para.gh_secret = ""
# LinkedIn
para.in_app_id = ""
para.in_secret = ""
# Twitter
para.tw_app_id = ""
para.tw_secret = ""
# Microsoft
para.ms_app_id = ""
para.ms_secret = ""
```
You also need to set your host URL when running Scoold in production:
```
para.host_url = "https://your.scoold.url"
```
This is required for authentication requests to be redirected back to the origin.

## Customizing the UI

- **HTML** templates are in `src/main/resources/templates/`
- **CSS** stylesheets can be found in `src/main/resources/static/styles/`
- **JavaScript** files can be found in `src/main/resources/static/scripts`
