Scoold is a Q&A platform written in Java. It's an old project (~2011) that was recently refactored and open-sourced.
The primary goal of this project is educational but it can also be integrated as Q&A section within your website.

Scoold can run on Heroku or any other PaaS. It's lightweight - the backend is handled by a separate service called
[Para](https://github.com/Erudika/para). Scoold does not require a database, and the controller logic is really simple
because all the heavy lifting is delegated to Para. This makes the code easier to read and can be learned
quickly by junior developers.

### Features

- Full featured Q&A platform
- Database-agnostic, optimized for cloud deployment
- Full-text search
- Distributed object cache
- Location-based search and "near me" filtering of posts
- I18n and branding customization
- Spring Boot project (single JAR)
- Reputation and voting system with badges
- Minimal frontend JS code based on jQuery
- Modern, responsive layout powered by Materialize CSS
- Social login (Facebook, Google) with Gravatar support
- SEO friendly

### Live Demo

*Scoold is deployed on a free dyno and might take a minute to wake up.*
###[Live demo on Heroku](https://live.scoold.com)

### Quick Start

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Erudika/scoold)

1. Clone and build the project with `mvn install`
2. Execute it with `java -jar target/scoold-X.Y.Z.jar` or `mvn spring-boot:run`
3. Start a [Para server instance](https://paraio.org/docs)
4. Open `localhost:8000` in your browser

### Configuration

The most important settings are `para.endpoint` - the URL of the Para server, as well as,
`para.access_key` and `para.secret_key`. Connection to a Para server is required for Scoold to run.

This is an example of what your **`application.conf`** should look like:
```
para.app_name = "Scoold"
para.port = 8000
para.env = "development"
para.endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"
para.access_key = "app:scoold"
para.secret_key = "*****************"
para.fb_app_id = "123456789"
para.fb_secret = "***********************"
para.gmaps_api_key = "********************************"
para.google_client_id = "********************************"
para.admin_ident = "admin@domain.com"
para.auth_cookie = "scoold-auth"
para.support_email = "support@scoold.com"
para.app_secret_key = "secret"
para.core_package_name = "com.erudika.scoold.core"
```
