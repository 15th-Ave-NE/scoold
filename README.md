Scoold is a Q&A platform written in Java. It's an old project (~2011) which was recently refactored and open-sourced.
The primary goal of this project is educational but it can also be integrated as Q&A section within your website.

Scoold can run on Heroku or any other PaaS. It's built on top of another project called [Para](https://github.com/Erudika/para).
Scoold does not require a database, and the controller logic is really simple because all the backend services are
delegated to Para. This makes the code easier to read and can be learned quickly by junior programmers.

### Features

- Full featured Q&A platform
- Database-agnostic, optimized for cloud deployment
- Full-text search
- Distributed object cache
- Location-based search and "near me" filtering of posts
- I18n and branding customization
- Spring Boot project (single JAR)
- Reputation and voting system with badges
- Minimal frontend JS code based on jQuery
- Modern, responsive layout powered by Materialize CSS
- Social login (Facebook, Google) with Gravatar support
- SEO friendly

### Quick Start

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Erudika/scoold)

1. Clone and build the project
2. Execute it with `java -jar target/scoold-X.Y.Z.jar` or `mvn spring-boot:run`
3. Start a Para server
4. Open `localhost:8000` in your browser

### Configuration

The most important settings are `para.endpoint` - the URL of the Para server, as well as,
`para.access_key` and `para.secret_key`. Connection to a Para server is required for Scoold to run.

This is an example of what your **`application.conf`** should look like:
```
para.app_name = "Scoold"
para.port = 8000
para.env = "development"
para.endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"
para.access_key = "app:scoold"
para.secret_key = "*****************"
para.fb_app_id = "123456789"
para.fb_secret = "***********************"
para.gmaps_api_key = "********************************"
para.google_client_id = "********************************"
para.admin_ident = "admin@domain.com"
para.auth_cookie = "scoold-auth"
para.support_email = "support@scoold.com"
para.app_secret_key = "secret"
para.core_package_name = "com.erudika.scoold.core"
```
